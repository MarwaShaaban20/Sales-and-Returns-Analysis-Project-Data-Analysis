### Sales and Returns Analysis Project

This project focuses on providing a detailed sales and returns analysis using Power BI, guiding decision-makers in understanding key factors impacting sales performance across different regions and product categories. The project follows a structured approach to ensure data clarity, insightful analysis, and impactful visual representation.

#### Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - The first phase of the project involved cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure data accuracy and consistency. This step includes handling missing data, formatting issues, and removing inconsistencies to prepare the data for analysis.

2. **Analysis Questions Phase**:
   - During this phase, key business questions are formulated to drive the analysis. These questions aim to uncover insights that are critical for organizational decision-making. Examples include:
     - What impact do product categories and regions have on sales performance?
     - How do customer demographics (income, marital status, etc.) influence sales?
     - What is the return rate by product category, and how does it vary across regions?
     - Which product categories and brands are driving the most profit?
   
3. **Create Appropriate Data Model**:
   - A well-structured data model was developed to support the analysis. The model incorporates key relationships between fact tables (e.g., sales, returns) and dimension tables (e.g., products, regions, customers), ensuring the analysis is accurate and relevant.
   - A calendar dimension is added to support time-based analysis, enabling the use of time intelligence functions.

4. **Dashboard Phase and Presentation**:
   - A Power BI dashboard is created to visualize the insights derived from the analysis questions. The dashboard presents data using clear, concise visual elements, ensuring decision-makers can quickly interpret the results.
   - The dashboard includes at least three pages, with interactive buttons for easy navigation, including drill-through pages and bookmarks for resetting slicer effects. 
   - The dashboard highlights important metrics such as sales performance by region, customer demographics, product return rates, and the impact of different product categories on overall sales.

#### Deliverables:
- **Analysis Questions**: A set of insightful analysis questions, focusing on sales and returns trends across various dimensions such as regions, product categories, and customer demographics.
- **Key Insights**: Highlights of the most interesting findings from the data, such as top-performing regions, products with the highest return rates, and sales trends by customer segment.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: A well-designed, multi-page Power BI dashboard featuring advanced features like time intelligence functions (DAX), drill-through pages, and interactive bookmarks for seamless user navigation.

#### General Notes:
- The project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis and visualization using Power BI.
- It incorporates advanced DAX functions for deriving time-based insights and employs best practices in data visualization, such as clear visuals, consistent color schemes, and effective use of titles and labels.
- The project is designed to be a portfolio-ready showcase of skills, highlighting the ability to clean data, perform in-depth analysis, and create professional, actionable dashboards.
